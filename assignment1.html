          This assignment is called Blink!, and requires us to make three LED's blink independently
          of one another using Arduino.

              The setup() function completes the setup by initializing all the pins that the LED's are
              connected to. The far right yellow LED is pin 10, the middle white LED is pin 6, and
              the far left yellow LED is pin 2. The loop() function makes the LED's blink in a pattern.
              The code is organized into three sections: the far right yellow LED, the middle white
              LED, and the far left yellow LED. The yellow LED on the right is on for 4 seconds,
              the white LED is on for 1/4th of a second, and the yellow LED on the left is on for
              one second. 1/10th of a second passes each time before the system blinks the next light.
              Initially, I was confused what purpose the "delay(10);" in my code was serving, after
              I had already turned the light on and off. Lia Johansen helped clarify for me that it
              was the delay time before the next line of code ran (in this case, turning the next
              light on).

              This is my circuit, complete with three LED's, three resistors, and multiple wires
              that connect to both ground and power. Using the equation V=IR, I determined the
              correct magnitude for the resistors. The voltage coming from the computer is 5V,
              and the LED's need 20mA to run. For the yellow LED's, this means 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R.
              20mA is .02A, so 3.2V = .02A * R. Dividing both sides by .02A, you get 160 = R.
              Although not exactly 160, I used the 220 ohm resistors because they were the closest and
              it's better to supply less current than more current. The white LED takes more voltage,
              so the math changes to 5V - 3.3V = 20mA * R. Solving the equation gets 85 ohms. I chose to
              use the 100 ohm resistors because they created a current of 17mA, which was close
              enough to 20 to still power the LED but not enough to blow up the light.

              This is my circuit in action, looping once. The far right yellow LED starts on first,
              then moving to the white LED for a brief time, then ending with the far left LED. The
              lights would continue blinking indefinitely, but the video cuts out after one loop.
