          This assignment is called Blink!, and requires us to make three LED's blink independently
          of one another using Arduino.

              This is my schematic diagram and it's pretty cool huh

              This code snippet completes the setup by initializing all the pins that the LED's are
              connected to. The far right yellow LED is pin 10, the middle white LED is pin 6, and
              the far left yellow LED is pin 2.

            <figcaption>
              This code snippet makes the LED's blink in a pattern. The code is organized into three
              sections: the far right yellow LED, the middle white LED, and the far left yellow LED.
              The yellow LED on the right is on for 4 seconds, the white LED is on for 1/4th of a
              second, and the yellow LED on the left is on for one second. 1/10th of a second passes
              each time before the system blinks the next light.

            <figcaption>
              This is my circuit, complete with three LED's, three resistors, and multiple wires
              that connect to both ground and power. Using the equation V=IR, I determined the
              correct magnitude for the resistors. The voltage coming from the computer is 5V,
              and the LED's need 20mA to run. This means 5V=20mA * R. 20mA is .02A, so 5V=.02A * R.
              Dividing both sides by .02A, you get 250 = R. Although not exactly 250, I used the
              220 resistors because they were the closest.

              This is my circuit in action, looping once. The far right yellow LED starts on first,
              then moving to the white LED for a brief time, then ending with the far left LED. The
              lights would continue blinking indefinitely, but the video cuts out after one loop.
