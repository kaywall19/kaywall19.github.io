        <h5>00: Overview</h5>
        <p id="overview">
          This assignment requires us to use two sensors and interact with the information coming
          from the arduino over serial. I chose a button and a thermistor as my two sensors, and
          the interactivity is changing colors based on temperature or button press.

              This is my schematic. Both the button and the thermistor are connected to the same 5V
              pin from the arduino. 5V goes to the button, and when the switch is pressed down, flows
              through a 220 ohm resistor and then to ground. During this travel an input pin connected
              to arduino pin 2 uses digitalRead() to measure the state of the button. The transistor
              has a similar circuit. Power flows through the transistor to the second 10k resistor,
              and then to ground. This creates a voltage divide, which turns changes in resistance
              into a change in voltage which analogRead() can read. This input pin is connected to
              A0 in the arduino.

                delay(200);

              The arduino code is relatively simple. The pins are assigned to a more helpful variable
              name, and then both are initialized so I can read in the button presses and the
              temperature. I am sending information over serial to my p5.js, so I set the serial
              communication speed at 9600. In the loop, I read in both of the values and print them
              to the serial in a tuple pair. There is a 200ms delay in between the sensor and button
              readings.

              When reading in the button, I was expecting to receive either a 1 or a 0, letting me
              know whether or not the button was pressed. The thermistor is analogRead(), which means
              I am given a range of values. Based on current conditions in my house and my experience
              with using the thermistor in assignment 3, I expected to see analogRead() values range
              in between 400 and 700. This is about in the middle of the 0-1023 range which
              analogRead() provides. This makes sense, because my warm and cold conditions were only
              a fraction of the range the thermistor can read.

            As listed above, I drew inspiration from the Loop example on the p5.js website. The code
            begins by initializing a lot of variables needed for the serial communication and the
            interactivity. The setup() function is where the serial communication gets set up.
            Callbacks are made to the serial instance so the serial is ready to open, receive data,
            check for errors, and close. The functions below are used for debugging and ensuring the
            connection between the port and server are functioning properly. The function serialEvent()
            begins the actual processing by reading in the values from the serial monitor and
            separating them out of the tuple into their respective variables. If any errors arise
            during this process, there is a catch to handle them. The function draw() is looped over
            on itself, and it's this method that draws the moving line and changes the colors based
            on interactivity. If the button is actively being pressed, the screen changes to a
            lighter blue. When the button is released, the screen returns to its normal color. As the
            line continues on its moving path, it can be either blue-gray or orange, depending on
            the temperature. The stroke weight is set so the line actually shows up, the position
            is decremented to make it look like the line is moving, and then the line is actually
            drawn. Lia and Lily were helpful in trying to understand the serial communication part
            of the code.

              This is my circuit, complete with one button, one transistor, and various wires going
              to inputs, power, and ground.
              <br>
              <br>
              Since I decided to use the thermistor, I needed to determine the correct amount for
              the fixed resistor. To do this, I first found the maximum and minimum resistance for
              the conditions at my house. The warmest condition was room temperature, and for the
              coldest condition I touched an ice cube to it. I measured 13.3k ohm resistance for the
              warmest condition, and 34.4k ohm resistance for the coldest condition. I also knew that
              V(in) was 5V.
              <br>
              <br>
              Based on these values, I used the equation V(out) = (R(2) / R(1) + R(2)) * 5 to
              determine my V(out). I plugged in various R(2) values in the hopes of finding a V(out)
              difference using the max and min resistance of R(1) that was large. A large voltage
              divide is important because I wanted my interactivity to showcase a variety of values.
              I found that a 10k resistor created the largest V(out) difference, and thus the biggest
              voltage divide. Thus, depending on what resistance the variable resistor was set to, I
              could expect to read voltages between 1.13V and 2.15V.
              <br>
              <br>
              Next up was determining a resistor to use for the button. The button has a 5V voltage
              drop and has a maximum allowable current of 40 ohms. I used 30 ohms in my calculation
              so as to not exceed the maximum. This means 5V = 30mA * R, so 5V = .03A * R. R therefore
              equals 166 ohms. Although not exactly 166, I used the 220 ohm resistor because I felt it
              was safer to supply less current than accidentally go over the maximum.

              This is my code in action. When the button is pressed, the color on the web page changes
              slightly. It's hard to see on the video, but the color change is much clearer in person.
              When the thermistor is reading relatively warm values for its range, the line moving
              is orange. When it is reading cooler values for its range, the color changes to a
              blue gray.
