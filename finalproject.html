              These are my brainstormed ideas for potential final projects. The first idea is an
              interactive stuffed animal that gives out facts when you interact with various parts
              of its body. For example, if you boop the lions nose he could give you a fact about
              lions and their sensing capabilities. This is my favorite idea because I love stuffed
              animals.
              <br>
              <br>
              The second idea is a cool clock. This is one of the more difficult ideas,
              because I would want to work with wood or metal to make a modern covering for the
              digital display so it actually looks like a clock. The clock would also sense the
              surrounding light in the environment, and emit a light glow accordingly. If the room
              is dark, the clock would have a soft glow.
              <br>
              <br>
              The third idea is a drum that emits different
              sounds based on the force that the surface is hit. If the drum is hit lightly, it would
              emit a higher pitch sound. If the drum is hit forcefully, it would emit a lower pitch
              sound.
