        <h5>00: Overview</h5>
        <p id="overview">
          This project makes a prototype of a kid's toy. Based on various touches by the user, the
          otter will say different facts about otter's. If you scratch the otter's belly, it will
          say a fact about otters, and if you boop the otter's nose, it will say a different fact.
        </p>
        <h5>01: Brainstorming Ideas</h5>
        <section id= "schematic">

            <img src="final project/lion.jpg" alt="ideation"/>

            <figcaption>
              These are my brainstormed ideas for potential final projects. The first idea is an
              interactive stuffed animal that gives out facts when you interact with various parts
              of its body. For example, if you boop the lions' nose he could give you a fact about
              lions and their sensing capabilities. This is my favorite idea because I love stuffed
              animals.
              <br>
              <br>
              The second idea is a cool clock. This is one of the more difficult ideas,
              because I would want to work with wood or metal to make a modern covering for the
              digital display so it actually looks like a clock. The clock would also sense the
              surrounding light in the environment, and emit a light glow accordingly. If the room
              is dark, the clock would have a soft glow.
              <br>
              <br>
              The third idea is a drum that emits different
              sounds based on the force that the surface is hit. If the drum is hit lightly, it would
              emit a higher pitch sound. If the drum is hit forcefully, it would emit a lower pitch
              sound
              <br>
              <br>
              Ultimately the idea I chose to do for my final project was animating a stuffed animal,
              although I chose an otter instead of a lion. I wanted the otter to say facts about itself
              because I'm in a wildlife conservation class that I found really interesting and
              wanted to pass on some of the cool things I had learned and my appreciation for
              wildlife. I'm framing my project as a prototype of a children's toy.

              There are two capacitive sensors, each connected to a send and receiving
              pin. Each sensor has one, 10M ohm resistor so touch can be sensed through the otter's
              thick fur. The two sensing wires go to the otter's belly and nose. The DFPlayerMini was
              the most complicated to wire, but I followed the datasheets for the component so I
              knew what to wire where. The VCC pin goes to 5V, the RX and TX pins go to arduino digital
              input pins for communication with the arduino, and the fourth wire goes to the ground
              arduino pin. There are two resistors that add up to 3K ohms between the arduino and the RX
              pin that are used to drown out excess environmental noise. The last two wires going from the
              DFPlayerMini go in and out of the speaker so the DFPlayerMini can talk to the speaker.
              There is also a 100 ohm resistor directly between power and ground because my system
              is connected to a battery bank that shuts off if there's not a constant draw of current,
              even if it's small. I added the 100 ohm resistor to keep the battery bank on.

          <pre><code>
          <figcaption>
            The code is long and does multiple things at the same time, so I tried my best to isolate
            them via code comments. The program starts out by importing the libraries needed to do
            capacitive sensing and talk with the DFPlayerMini. The code then declares a lot of
            variables and objects that are needed later in the program.

            Right after the libraries is the smoothing code. Since capacitive sensing fluctuates a lot,
            I smoothed the value before I analyze it to see if I should turn on the speaker or not.
            The same process is completed for both the belly and the nose sensor, and declares four
            variables that keep track of the placement in the array, get rid of old values in the
            array, and keep track of the total and average of the inputs.

            Next is the calibrating code. For some reason, upon inital turn on, the belly sensor takes
            a bit to even out. This variable declares a set time to wait before attempting to read
            the belly sensor, ensuring there's a stable value. This calibration period could be
            exaplained by the fluff and fur surrounding the wire.

            Next is the DFPlayerMini code that creates an object and instantiates serial communication
            to receive from the RX pin and transmit to the TX pin.

            Next is the capacitive sensing intializations. These lines create two sensors (one for
            the otter's belly, and one for the nose) that can receive inputs.

            The last intialization lines are creating places to store the previous read values from
            both sensors. Because capactive sensing can flucuate dramatically with an environment change,
            I didn't want my breakpoint for the sound to be a number. Instead, I chose my breakpoint
            to be how much a current value is above the previous value, which indicates a touch in
            any environment.

            The setup() function starts by starting the communication speed for the arduino and mp3,
            and the typical serial we've used before. Both speeds are set to 9600. The code then
            checks the connection between the DFPlayerMini, and if there is no connection then the
            code displays debugging messages. If the conenction is fine, the code moves on to initialize
            both of the reading arrays (for the belly and nose) to have initial starting values of 0.
            Lastly, the function sets the volume level so the speaker is loud enough to be heard
            through the otter's fur.

            The loop function runs continously, and is responsible for triggering what facts are
            played and when. The smoothing code for the belly and the nose is the same, just with
            different variables. For each sensor, the code gets rid of the oldest value, adds
            in the new value, adds the total of the values, and then averages those values to
            create the new smoothed value. If the end of the array has been reached, the code just
            starts over at the beginning of the array. The effect of this code is ensuring that
            there's no outliers and extreme values throwing off the sensor. This stabalizes the
            capactive sensors.

            The second part of the loop() function tries to tell if the sensor was touched. It takes
            the new smoothed value, subtracts a certain amount (different for each sensor), and then
            compares it with the previous value. If the new value is still larger than the previous
            value even after the subtractions, this means there was a big enough change to symbolize
            a touch. A different track (according to which sensor was touched) is played, and the code
            waits for the track to finish.

            To set the code up for next time, the old current value is set to the new previous value
            to continue the chain of comparisons. It also increments the calibrating variable by 1
            to count down the time until the belly sensor is calibrated and can accept sensor readings.
            The last thing in the loop() function is a small delay to set up for the next reading.

            Although it looks busy, the circuit matches the above schematic. The wire colors are
            mostly color coordinated to help with understanding. The first capacitive sensing circuit
            are the orange wires, and the second sensing circuit has the green wires. The RX and TX wires
            for the DFPlayerMini are yellow, red is power, black is ground, and the blue wires go
            to the speaker.

            I chose the 10M ohm resistors for the capactive sensing because I needed to sense light
            touch through the otter's thick fur. Testing 1M ohm resistors strung together worked
            when actual force was put on the otter, but using a 10M resistor allowed the user to do
            a light belly scratch or a lighter bop on the nose rather than the forced push.

            I chose the 1K and 2K resistors based off of suggestions from the internet. Initially,
            when I connected my speaker to my DFPlayerMini, it was broadcasting a loud, obnoxious
            sound. When I went troubleshooting on Google, people said to add resistors before the RX
            pin. I added a 2k resistor like google suggeseted, but I was still getting some background
            noise. I added another 1K resistor and it took care of the rest of the background noise.

            The last resistor I used was just between power and ground. I was connecting my Arduino
            to a power bank, and in order to keep that power bank on I needed to constantly draw minimal
            amounts of current. For that reason, I chose an 100ohm resistor to draw minimal current.

            In order to fit my circuit into my otter, I needed to solder it so the wires would stay
            in place and be able to shrink onto a smaller base than the large breadboard given
            in the arduino starter kit. This was my first time soldering in a while, so the
            execution wasn't perfect. But, it works! Because of this soldering, I'm able to fit
            my circuit into my otter without worrying about wires falling out.

            This is my final project in action! The otter says a fact about keystone species and sea
            urchins if you boop his nose, and he says a different fact about otter's fur when you
            tickle his belly. Make sure your sound is on! :)
