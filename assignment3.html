          This assignment is called InputOutput! and used a voltage divded with a variable resistor
          to change the state of an LED. My assignment used a thermistor to change an LED's color
          based on temperature.

              This is the schematic of my circuit. I created a voltage divide with one variable
              resistor (a thermistor) and a fixed resistor. An analog input pin between the resistors
              measures the voltage change brought by the combination of the variable resistor that
              changes the resistance and the voltage divide that converts the resistance change to
              a change in voltage. Digital pins 6, 5, and 3 are connected to resistors and then come
              together for an RGB LED. The RGB LED completes the circuit by connecting to ground.

              Before the setup() function, a bunch of variables are assigned. This includes all
              the input and output pins, sensor values, and a color variable to store the displayed
              color. The setup() function initalizes the three LED's in the RGB LED and sets the
              communication speed. The loop() function begins by reading the value from the
              voltage divide. This is a value between 0 and 1023, although since my voltage divide
              is smaller this range is limited. The map function maps these values to a new value
              between 0 and 30. Normally, the map function would map values to 0-225 and the values
              would be used in analogWrite. However, I chose to use the map function differently than
              it's original intent. I mapped to 30 because it was easily divisible by 3. The following
              if and if-else branches divide the map values into 3 colors. If the mapped values ie
              under 10, the LED turns pink. This is the coldest value. If the mapped value is between
              10 and 20, the color value is teal (this is moderate temparature). Lastly, if the
              mapped value is coming from a room temp thermistor, it will be 20-30 and turn the LED
              an orange color. For all of these branches, the color variable is set to the appropriate
              displayed color.

              The code also prints to the Arduino serial monitor the value read from the sensor and
              the corresponding color the LED should be at each value, for easy debugging.

              This is my circuit, complete with 1 RGB LED, two fixed resistors, 1 variable resistor,
              and wires that connect my circuit to ground and power. Using the equation V = IR, I
              determined the correct resistors for the RGB LED. Both the red and green LED's use
              1.8 V, so their calculation was 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R. Solving this equation, you get
              160 = R. Although not exactly 160, I used 220 ohm resistors because they were the
              closest and it's better to supply less current than more current. The blue LED takes
              more voltage, and uses 3.3V. The calculation is 5V - 3.3V = 20mA * R, and solving it
              gives R = 85. Although not exactly 85, I used the 100 ohm resistor because it was the
              closest and supplies less than max current.
              <br>
              <br>
              Since I decided to use the thermistor, I needed to determine the correct amount for
              the fixed resistor. To do this, I first looked up the thermistor in the datasheet. It
              said the max resistance was 277.2k ohms (coldest temperature), and the least resistance was
              61.9 ohms (warmest temperature). However, I could not reasonably achieve these conditions,
              so I measured with a multimeter the themistor at base state (in my house) for the
              warmest condition, and touching an ice cube for the coldest condition. I measured
              13.3k ohm resistance for the warmest condition, and 34.4k ohm resistance for the
              coldest condition. I also knew that V(in) was 5V.
              <br>
              <br>
              Based on these values, I used the equation V(out) = (R(2) / R(1) + R(2)) * 5 to
              determine my V(out). I plugged in 100, 220, 2k, and 10k values for R(2), and used both
              13.3k and 34.4k as my R(1)'s. Once I had done my calcuations, I compared the the
              different V(out) values for each resistance (min and max) at each R(2) amount against
              each other. I found that a 10k resistor created the largest V(out) difference, and thus
              the biggest voltage divide. The 100 ohm resistor gave a voltage difference of .023, the
              220 ohm resistor had a difference of .049, the 2k resistor had a difference of .38, and
              the 10k resistor had a difference of 1.02V. A large voltage divide is important because
              I wanted my LED to fill the range and showcase a variety of values. Although my voltage
              divide is not the highest I hoped it would be, I was unable to recreate the highest
              and lowest temps that the thermistor could handle in it's range. This explains the low
              voltage difference, because I'm using approximately 30% of the real range. Thus, depending
              on what resistance the variable resistor was set to, I could expect to read voltages
              between 1.13V and 2.15V.
              <br>
              <br>
              I then checked to see how much current was going from power to ground to confirm 10k was
              the right resistor. 5V = I * (10k + 13.3k). I = .21mA, so the amount of current from
              power to ground is not that much.
              <br>
              <br>
              This assignment was really difficult to me, as it took me a long time to understand
              the voltage divide. Additionally, I struggled to understand how to find the V(out)'s
              because I didn't realize you would use a multimeter to calculate the R(1) resistance.
              Nadya, Jasper, and Lia have been great sounding boards and have been extremely helpful
              in undestanding.

              This is my circuit in action, with one full rotation from warm to moderate to cold and
              back again. Once the circuit begins, the LED lights up with a color that corresponds to
              the temperature of the room. If the room is warm, the LED is orange. If the room is
              moderate, the LED is teal. If the room is cold, the LED is pink. I used an ice cube
              (hidden in a paper towel because it was cold to handle) to get the thermistor to change
              its reading.
