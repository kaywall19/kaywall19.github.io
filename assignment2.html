          This assignment is called Fade!, and requires us to use a button to turn on LED's. One of
          the LED's should fade, meaning to gradually get dimmer.

              This is the schematic of my circuit. Both LED's are connected to different analog pins,
              have resistors, a yellow LED, and ground. The button is powered by the 5V pin, and when
              pushed, completes the circuit by sending 5V down to a pin measuring the input, a
              resistor, and ground.

              The setup() function completes the setup by initializing two pins as outputs for the
              LED and one pin as input to store when the button is pressed. It also initializes the
              pin 6 LED on and the pin 5 LED off. The loop() function begins by reading the input
              of pin 2. If the button was pressed, the code that dims, brightens, and blinks the LED's
              will run. The code begins by dimming and brightening the two LED's oppositely.
              It does this by using analogWrite and a for-loop. The for-loop traverses values from the
              0-255 spectrum 5 at a time, either starting at 255 and subtracting value, or starting
              at 0 and adding value. Pin 5 begins at 0 and brightens slowly, while the same for-loop
              dims the pin 6 LED that begins at a value of 255. The second for-loop does the opposite,
              brightening the dim LED and dimming the bright LED. Once this pattern of dimming and
              brightening occurs 3 times, the LED's move on to blinking. They first blink opposite
              from each other for 4 times with a 400 millisecond delay in between blinks. They then
              blink rapidly together for 3 times, then stay powered on. When both lights are high,
              the sequence is complete.

              This is my circuit, complete with two LED's, three resistors, one button, and wires
              that connect the circuit to ground and power. Using the equation V=IR, I determined the
              correct magnitude for the LED resistors. The voltage coming from the computer is 5V,
              and the LED's need 20mA to run. For yellow LED's, this means 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R.
              20mA is .02A, so 3.2V = .02A * R. Dividing both sides by .02A, you get 160 = R.
              Although not exactly 160, I used the 220 ohm resistors because they were the closest and
              it's better to supply less current than more current. The last resistor I needed was
              for the button. The button has a 5V voltage drop from power to ground, and has a
              maximum allowable current of 40 ohms. I used 30 ohms in my calculation so as to not
              exceed the maximum. This means 5V = 30mA * R, so 5V = .03A * R. R therefore equals
              166 ohms. Although not exactly 166, I used the 220 ohm resistor because I felt it was
              safer to supply less current than accidentally go over the maximum. Initially I was
              a little confused on how the current was flowing through the button and the
              orientation of it. However, Lia helped me traced through my circuit and I was able to
              follow the current and better understand how the button was behaving.

              This is my circuit in action, looping once. Once the button is pressed, the LED's
              start to fade in and out, opposite of each other. Once they a complete fade out and in
              for three times, the lights then start to blink quickly, still opposite of each other.
              Then the lights blink together at a quicker pace for three times. The circuit ends
              with both of the lights staying on. The video ends after one full cycle.
