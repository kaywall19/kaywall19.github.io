        <h5>00: Overview</h5>
        <p id="overview">
          This assignment requires us to use a transistor to control some output device with a higher
          load. To do this, we will separate load power from logic power, and use a sensor with
          inputs to control the transistor. I used an IR sensor with a remote to control an LED strip.

        <h5>01: Schematic</h5>

              This is the schematic of my circuit. I have a larger power source (12V) that is
              connected to the load, which in this case is an LED strip. I used a N-MOSFET transistor,
              so the transistor comes after the load in both the schematic and circuit. The D
              transistor pin is connected to the load, and then goes through the S pin to ground.
              Pin G is the output pin that goes to pin 10 in which I can write values to the transistor.
              The second half of my schematic is my IR sensor. The sensor is powered by 5V connected
              to the sensor Y pin. The current continues to ground through sensor pin G, and is read as
              an input through the sensor pin R which is connected to pin 6 on the arduino.

              The code begins by importing the IRremote library so we can make use of extra functionality
              for our sensor and remote. It then creates some variables to store the input and output
              pins from the sensor and transistor, respectively. It then instantiates an irrecv object
              which will be responsible for collecting the results from the IR remote. It creates
              a decode_results variable as defined in the object to store the data from the sensor.
              The setup() function starts communication with the Arduino serial monitor at 9600
              bits per second, enables the irrecv object to start listening for button presses on the
              remote, and tells the arduino built in LED to blink when a signal is recieved. I did
              this to make debugging easier. Even if something wasn't showing up on my serial monitor,
              I knew the button was being pressed because the built in LED blinked. Lastly, the setup()
              function initializes the transistor pin as output so I can open up the voltage gate.

              The loop() function continously runs, and listens for a code from the IR sensor to
              do certain activities. It begins by checking if a signal was received from the sensor.
              If there was no signal, the object resets and begins listening again. If there was
              a signal, the result is stored in a variable. The code then checks to see if the result
              from the sensor equals one of two buttons on the remote. If the code means the vol +
              button was pressed, then the code makes the LED strip begin brightening slowly by
              using a for loop and analogWriting the value of i to the transistor pin. It also
              prints out a "+" and i for easy debugging. The opposite happens if the sensor detects
              a vol - button push. The LED's begin to dim slowly, the serial monitor prints out a
              "-" and i, and the value of i is analogWritten to the transistor pin. Both if cases
              have a delay of 20ms in between each for loop interation so the user can observe the
              brightness/dimness changing and it doesn't go too fast. At the end of every cycle through
              the loop, the irrecv object resets so it can listen for the next signal.

              Even though the transistor we used was an all-or-nothing transistor (meaning it either
              opened the gate fully or closed it fully), I was still able to use analogWrite because
              analogWrite values are just different duty cycles that turn the LED strip on and off
              for certain ratios of time. analogWrite still uses all-or-nothing functionality, just
              at faster increments called duty cycles that create a dimming effect.

              This is my circuit, complete with one IR sensor, one transistor, one LED strip, and
              connections to various input/output pins, power, and ground.
              <br>
              <br>
              For the LED strip circuit, the voltage begins at 12V. The current travels through the
              LED strip, and uses up 10.8V of voltage during the voltage drop. This is because the
              LED strip has three LED's in series, and then a bunch of those segments in parallel.
              Since voltage is the same for parallel circuits, the only voltage drop that matters is
              because of the three LED's in series. Because they are white LED's, they each use up
              3.6V. 12V - 3.6V * 3 = 1.2V.
              <br>
              <br>
              I wanted to ensure I wasn't drawing more current than the transistor could handle.
              I first calculated V=IR for each segment of the LED strip. With a voltage drop of 10.8V
              mentioned above, and a resistance of 181 ohms marked on the LED strip, my equation was
              1.2V = I * 181ohms. This led to I = 6.6mA of current for each segment on the LED strip.
              From the documentation on the box, I saw that there were 300 LED's. Divided by three
              per strip, that means there's 100 segments. I multiplied 6.6mA by 100 to find the total
              current of the circuit, because current adds in parallel. I found that the total
              current the LED strip was drawing was .66A, much smaller than the 32A current the
              transistor could support.
              <br>
              <br>
              I double checked my calculation by arriving to the answer a different way. I did V=IR
              for the whole circuit. If 1.2V was the total voltage, I needed the total resistance.
              I did (1/R(total)) = (1/R(1)) * 100 segments. This led to a total resistance of 1.81 ohms.
              From there, I did 1.2V = I * 1.81ohms and found I = .66A. This confirmed my earlier
              calculation so I knew I was okay to use that transistor with that LED strip. I talked
              through this calculations with Lily and Lia to make sure we were all on the same page.

              The other half of my circuit is my sensor.

              This is my circuit in action. The LED strip starts off, and then by pressing the volume
              + button on the remote, it raises the brightness of the lights gradually until they area
              all the way on. When I press the volume - button the LED strip dims slowly until it
              turns off. The included video has two sets of brightening and dimming.
