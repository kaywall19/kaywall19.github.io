        <h5>00: Overview</h5>
        <p id="overview">
          This assignment requires us to use a transistor to control some output device with a higher
          load. To do this, we will separate load power from logic power, and use a sensor with
          inputs to control the transistor. I used an IR sensor with a remote to control an LED strip.

        <h5>01: Schematic</h5>

              This is the schematic of my circuit. I have a larger power source (12V) that is
              connected to the load, which in this case is an LED strip. I used a N-MOSFET transistor,
              so the transistor comes after the load in both the schematic and circuit. The D
              transistor pin is connected to the load, and then goes through the S pin to ground.
              Pin G is the output pin that goes to pin 10 in which I can write values to the transistor.
              The second half of my schematic is my IR sensor. The sensor is powered by 5V connected
              to the sensor Y pin. The current continues to ground through sensor pin G, and is read as
              an input through the sensor pin R which is connected to pin 6 on the arduino.

              The code begins by importing the IRremote library so we can make use of extra functionality
              for our sensor and remote. It then creates some variables to store the input and output
              pins from the sensor and transistor, respectively. It then instantiates an irrecv object
              which will be responsible for collecting the results from the IR remote. It creates
              a decode_results variable as defined in the object to store the data from the sensor.
              The setup() function starts communication with the Arduino serial monitor at 9600
              bits per second, enables the irrecv object to start listening for button presses on the
              remote, and tells the arduino built in LED to blink when a signal is recieved. I did
              this to make debugging easier. Even if something wasn't showing up on my serial monitor,
              I knew the button was being pressed because the built in LED blinked. Lastly, the setup()
              function initializes the transistor pin as output so I can open up the voltage gate.
              pinMode uses LOW as a default, so when I initialized the transistor pin using pinMode
              and set it to output, it is initially set to LOW because of the default behavior of
              pinMode. This means the transistor "switch" is closed and no voltage is passing through.

              The loop() function continously runs, and listens for a code from the IR sensor to
              do certain activities. It begins by checking if a signal was received from the sensor.
              If there was no signal, the object resets and begins listening again. If there was
              a signal, the result is stored in a variable. The code then checks to see if the result
              from the sensor equals one of two buttons on the remote. If the code means the vol +
              button was pressed, then the code makes the LED strip begin brightening slowly by
              using a for loop and analogWriting the value of i to the transistor pin. It also
              prints out a "+" and i for easy debugging. The opposite happens if the sensor detects
              a vol - button push. The LED's begin to dim slowly, the serial monitor prints out a
              "-" and i, and the value of i is analogWritten to the transistor pin. Both if cases
              have a delay of 20ms in between each for loop interation so the user can observe the
              brightness/dimness changing and it doesn't go too fast. At the end of every cycle through
              the loop, the irrecv object resets so it can listen for the next signal.

              Even though the transistor we used was an all-or-nothing transistor (meaning it either
              opened the gate fully or closed it fully), I was still able to use analogWrite because
              analogWrite values are just different duty cycles that turn the LED strip on and off
              for certain ratios of time. analogWrite still uses all-or-nothing functionality, just
              at faster increments called duty cycles that create a dimming effect.

              This is my circuit, complete with one IR sensor, one transistor, one LED strip, and
              connections to various input/output pins, power, and ground.

              For the LED strip circuit, the voltage begins at 12V. The current travels through the
              LED strip, and uses up approximately 9.6V during the voltage drop. This is because the
              LED strip has three LED's in series, and then a bunch of those segments in parallel.
              Since voltage is the same for parallel circuits, the only voltage drop that matters is
              because of the three LED's in series. The estimated voltage drop is 9.6V because white
              LED's typically take up 3.2V, but the exact voltage drop of the LED strip is unknown
              because it doesn't say it in the documentation.

              I wanted to ensure I wasn't drawing more current than the transistor could handle.
              I used the equation P = V * I to determine how much current my LED strip would draw.
              The LED strip is 18W and uses 12V. Using 18W = 12V * I, I got 1.5A = I. This is way
              under the 32A that the transistor can support, so I knew I wasn't sending too much
              current through the transistor. I talked through these calculations with Lia and Lily
              to make sure P = V * I matched up with our V = I * R conceptual understanding. With
              some clarification from Nadya, we were all on the same page.

              <br>
              The other half of my circuit is my sensor. The sensor has an internal resistor, so I
              could wire power to ground without needing a fixed resistor in the breadboard. The
              current flows from power, to the sensor, and then to ground. There is an input pin
              connected to the sensor to read the IR signals made by the remote and allow my code
              to use those values.

              This is my circuit in action. The LED strip starts off, and then by pressing the volume
              + button on the remote, it raises the brightness of the lights gradually until they area
              all the way on. When I press the volume - button the LED strip dims slowly until it
              turns off. The included video has two sets of brightening and dimming.
