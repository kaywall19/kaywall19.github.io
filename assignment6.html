        <h5>00: Overview</h5>
        <p id="overview">
          This assignment creates an interactive website with p5.js that talks to the arduino. Using
          JSON parsing, Serial, and p5.js, this assignment uses two sensors to change the webpage,
          and a button on the webpage causes an LED wired to the arduino to turn on.

              The schematic for this circuit is very similar to my schematic for the last assignment.
              It uses the same sensors as assignment 5, the thermistor and the button (which is
              being counted as a sensor for this assignment). The thermistor gets 5V, and then creates
              a voltage divide with a 10k resistor. The current flows to ground, and the input pin
              A0 measures the resistance-turned-voltage value from the voltage divide. The button
              also gets 5V, has a 220 ohm resistor, travels to ground, and is read by a wire connecting
              to input pin 2. The new addition from assignment 5 is the white LED, which is connected
              to pin 13. It has a 100 ohm resistor and then travels through the LED to ground.

              The arduino code is relatively simple. The pins are assigned to a more helpful variable
              name, and then both are initialized so I can read in the button presses and the
              temperature. A third pin is also initialized for writing to the white LED output. I am
              sending information over serial to my p5.js, so I set the serial communication speed at
              9600. In the loop, I read in both of the values and print them to the serial in a
              tuple pair. There is a 200ms delay in between the sensor and button readings. However,
              my the web also talks back to my arduino, and the communication exists both ways.
              Before sending the sensor values to the monitor, the code checks if there's any serial
              data available that was sent from my p5.js code. If there is data available it is read
              in. The value is either a 49 or 48 (the ASCII equivalent of 0 or 1) and represents
              whether the opposite of the current state of the button. For instance, if the LED is on,
              then the read Serial will be 1, which means the LED will be turned on. If the LED is
              currently off, the read serial will be 0 and the LED will be turned off based on the
              arduino code. Basically, clicking on the button on the webpage will toggle the LED
              on and off.


              When reading in the button, I was expecting to receive either a 1 or a 0, letting me
              know whether or not the button was pressed. The thermistor is analogRead(), which means
              I am given a range of values. Based on current conditions in my house and my experience
              with using the thermistor in assignment 3, I expected to see analogRead() values range
              in between 400 and 700. This is about in the middle of the 0-1023 range which
              analogRead() provides. This makes sense, because my warm and cold conditions were only
              a fraction of the range the thermistor can read.

              As listed above, I drew inspiration from the Loop example on the p5.js website. The code
              begins by initializing a lot of variables needed for the serial communication and the
              interactivity. The setup() function is where the serial communication gets set up.
              Callbacks are made to the serial instance so the serial is ready to open, receive data,
              check for errors, and close. The functions below are used for debugging and ensuring the
              connection between the port and server are functioning properly. The function serialEvent()
              begins the actual processing by reading in the values from the serial monitor and
              separating them out of the tuple into their respective variables. If any errors arise
              during this process, there is a catch to handle them. It also adds an event listener
              to the button in the HTML. The button is listening for a click, and whenever the button
              is clicked it calls the led() function. The led() function is in charge of toggling
              the state of the white LED in the arduino. For every button press on the webpage, if
              the LED is off, the code tells the arduino to turn it on.  If the LED is on, then then a
              button press on the website will turn it off. The function draw() is looped over
              on itself, and it's this method that draws the moving line and changes the colors based
              on interactivity. If the button is actively being pressed, the screen changes to a
              lighter blue. When the button is released, the screen returns to its normal color. As the
              line continues on its moving path, it can be either blue-gray or orange, depending on
              the temperature. The stroke weight is set so the line actually shows up, the position
              is decremented to make it look like the line is moving, and then the line is actually
              drawn. Lia and Lily were helpful in trying to understand the serial communication part
              of the code.

              This is my circuit, complete with one button, one transistor, one white LED, and various
              wires going to inputs, power, and ground.
              <br>
              <br>
              Since I decided to use the thermistor, I needed to determine the correct amount for
              the fixed resistor. To do this, I first found the maximum and minimum resistance for
              the conditions at my house. The warmest condition was room temperature, and for the
              coldest condition I touched an ice cube to it. I measured 13.3k ohm resistance for the
              warmest condition, and 34.4k ohm resistance for the coldest condition. I also knew that
              V(in) was 5V.
              <br>
              <br>
              Based on these values, I used the equation V(out) = (R(2) / R(1) + R(2)) * 5 to
              determine my V(out). I plugged in various R(2) values in the hopes of finding a V(out)
              difference using the max and min resistance of R(1) that was large. A large voltage
              divide is important because I wanted my interactivity to showcase a variety of values.
              I found that a 10k resistor created the largest V(out) difference, and thus the biggest
              voltage divide. Thus, depending on what resistance the variable resistor was set to, I
              could expect to read voltages between 1.13V and 2.15V.
              <br>
              <br>
              Next up was determining a resistor to use for the button. The button has a 5V voltage
              drop and has a maximum allowable current of 40 ohms. I used 30 ohms in my calculation
              so as to not exceed the maximum. This means 5V = 30mA * R, so 5V = .03A * R. R therefore
              equals 166 ohms. Although not exactly 166, I used the 220 ohm resistor because I felt it
              was safer to supply less current than accidentally go over the maximum.
              <br>
              <br>
              The last step was determining the resistor to use for my white LED. The white LED has
              a voltage drop of 3.3V, and a max current of 20mA. Using 5V - 3.3V = 20mA * R, I got
              an R value of 85 ohms. This was close enough to my 100ohm resistor in the kit, and I
              was guaranteed to not go over the maximum current.

              This is my code in action. When the button is pressed, the color on the web page changes
              slightly. It's hard to see on the video, but the color change is much clearer in person.
              Depending on the temperature of the thermistor, the moving line is either orange or
              blue-gray. There is a button on the webpage, and when that button is clicked the
              white LED on the arduino is toggled on or off.
